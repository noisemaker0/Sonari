# Agent E Plan: Backend – Subscription, Wallet, Analytics APIs

## Directory
- `/backend/api`

## Responsibilities
- Implement Subscription API (artist, premium plans, recurring payments)
- Implement Wallet/Coin API (coin balance, Stripe top-up)
- Implement Analytics API (track/report events)
- Use shared types and OpenAPI/Swagger for API contracts
- Integrate with Stripe for payments and subscriptions
- Write unit and integration tests for all endpoints
- Merge work daily and request code review
- Communicate any changes needed to shared types or API contracts

## Tech Stack
- Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, TypeScript

## Deliverables
- `subscription.ts` – Subscription API endpoints
- `wallet.ts` – Wallet/Coin API endpoints
- `analytics.ts` – Analytics API endpoints
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all endpoints
- Unit and integration tests

## Milestones
1. Scaffold Subscription, Wallet, and Analytics API endpoints with OpenAPI docs
2. Integrate Stripe for payments and subscriptions
3. Implement analytics event tracking and reporting
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Code review and merge

## Best Practices
- Use only shared types/interfaces for data
- Document all endpoints in OpenAPI/Swagger
- Add analytics/logging for major actions
- Document any changes to shared contracts
