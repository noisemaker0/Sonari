# Agent F Plan: Shared – Types, API Clients, Validation

## Directory
- `/shared`

## Responsibilities
- Define and maintain TypeScript interfaces for all entities (User, Song, Playlist, Auth, etc.)
- Build and document API clients for frontend/backend use
- Set up validation schemas (Zod, Yup) for shared use
- Coordinate with all other agents to ensure contracts are clear and up to date
- Document all changes in `/shared/README.md`
- Merge work daily and request code review

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- Zod or Yup (validation)

## Deliverables
- `/types` – TypeScript interfaces
- `/api` – API clients
- `/validation` – Validation schemas
- `/README.md` – Documentation of all shared contracts

## Milestones
1. Scaffold all types/interfaces for core entities
2. Build API client stubs for all endpoints
3. Set up validation schemas for all entities
4. Document all contracts and changes
5. Code review and merge

## Best Practices
- Use only TypeScript for all shared code
- Keep contracts up to date with all agents
- Document all changes in `/shared/README.md`
