# Errors and Fixes from Automated Test Runs

## Backend (Node.js/Express)

### Errors Found
- Many tests failed initially due to missing dependencies: `mongoose`, `jsonwebtoken`, `supertest`, `bcryptjs`, `express`, `cors`, `helmet`, `compression`, `morgan`, `express-rate-limit`, `dotenv`, `express-validator`.
- After installing dependencies, some tests still fail due to:
  - Timeout errors in user model tests (likely due to async operations or improper teardown).
  - Some tests require environment variables or test DB setup.

### Fixes Applied
- Installed all missing backend dependencies.
- Installed `dotenv` and `express-validator` for environment and validation support.

### Remaining Issues
- Timeout errors in user model tests (increase timeout or fix async code/teardown).
- Some tests may require `.env` or test DB setup.

## Frontend (React Native/Redux)

### Errors Found
- Tests fail due to missing dependencies: `react`, `react-native`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `@testing-library/react-native`, `redux-mock-store`, `react-test-renderer`, `axios`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `react-native-track-player`.
- Babel/Jest not fully configured for React Native/JSX/ESM.
- AsyncStorage and other React Native modules do not work in Node.js test environment (ReferenceError: window is not defined).
- Jest cannot parse JSX/ESM in some test files.

### Fixes Applied
- Installed all missing frontend dependencies.
- Added `babel.config.js` with `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-react`.

### Remaining Issues
- Jest still cannot run React Native tests due to environment mismatch (Node.js vs. React Native runtime).
- AsyncStorage and other React Native APIs need to be mocked for tests to run in Node.js.
- Babel/Jest config may need further adjustment for React Native.

---

## Next Steps
- Mock React Native modules (like AsyncStorage) in Jest config or test setup.
- Adjust Babel/Jest config for React Native/ESM/JSX support.
- Increase test timeouts or fix async/teardown issues in backend tests.
- Ensure `.env` and test DB are set up for backend tests.
- Re-run tests after these fixes and iterate as needed.

---

## Summary
- All critical missing dependencies have been installed.
- Most test failures are now due to environment/configuration issues, not missing code.
- Further work is needed to fully support React Native testing in this environment and to stabilize backend test teardown.
